Virus Population Dynamics Simulation with Drug Treatment

To create a simple but insightful simulation of virus replication and evaluate the impact of a drug that reduces virus replication after a specific number of days.


Simulation Setup:

The virus replicates at a constant rate each day.

A drug is introduced after a specific number of days which reduces the effective replication rate.

The virus population is tracked over time and visualized.

Visualization:

A line plot shows virus growth over time with a vertical line marking the day drug treatment starts.

The y-axis is on a logarithmic scale to make trends clearer.

Result Interpretation
Before Drug Introduction:
The virus count grows exponentially due to the high replication rate. This models an unchecked infection phase.

After Drug Introduction:
The population growth slows significantly. The drop is not immediate due to prior buildup but stabilizes or declines with continued treatment.
